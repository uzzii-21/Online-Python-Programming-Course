    "=>Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "=>It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Classes\n",
    "A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class . An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "In python, functions too are objects. So they have attributes like other objects. ... We can also assign new attributes to them, as well as retrieve the values of those attributes. For handling attributes, Python provides us with “getattr” and “setattr”, a function that takes three arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object \n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language. Unlike procedure oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stress on objects. Object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior \n",
    "Object Behavior and Special Methods. Objects in Python are generally classified according to their behaviors and the features that they implement. ... User-defined classes can define new objects that behave like the built-in types simply by supplying an appropriate subset of the special methods described in this section.\n",
